# Create-your-own-Audiobook
This Python script reads a PDF file, extracts the text and converts the text to audio. Just make sure that the PDF file is in the same folder. 

# Getting Started
Add the PDF file to the folder. Replace the name 'Ashlee Vance - Elon Musk; Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.pdf' with the name of your file. Make sure your device is connected to the internet (for gTTS API). Upon successful execution, a file ('sound.mp3') should appear in the folder.
